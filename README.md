# Library-Management-System
 LMS is library management system built in Java and Microsoft Access as its backend. The netbeans project file is given as well the runnable jar file, i have removed the access database file as it had my own data but you can provide your own database with it. This is something that i built in my 5th semester during my bachelor studies at university of peshawar.
